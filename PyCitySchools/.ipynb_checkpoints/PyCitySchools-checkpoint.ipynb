    "Math and Reading scores and passing rates were analyzed to spot any underlying trends. The data comes from nearly 40,000 High School students, distributed among 15 schools. All students are in grades 9 to 12.\n",
    "\n",
    "Important sidenote: For clarity and ease of understanding, scores are rounded to the nearest tenth, and percentages are rounded to the nearest hundreth, both in analysis and in the DataFrames.\n",
    "\n",
    "The following trends have been observed:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "1. STUDENTS SCORE BETTER IN READING THAN IN MATH.\n",
    "Overall, students have a much better score in Reading (81.9) than in Math (79.0)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "2. SCORES ARE RELATIVELY CONSISTENT BY GRADE.\n",
    "While average scores are different by school,the scores per Grade Level at each school are rarely off by more than 2 points.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "3. SPENDING PER STUDENT IS INVERSELY PROPORTIONAL SCORING.\n",
    "The more money spent per capita on a student leads to lower scoring in BOTH Math and Reading.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "4. CHARTER SCHOOLS OUTPERFORM THEIR DISTRICT COUNTERPARTS, ESPECIALLY IN MATH.\n",
    "Compared by School Type, Charter School students Score were higher than District students by 7.4 points. They also outperform District Students in Reading, but by less than 3 points. \n"
